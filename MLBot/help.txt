# Zohencel AI - ML Bot (Community Edition)

**World's First 'Text to ML Model' Chat Application**

## Introduction
Zohencel AI ML Bot is a revolutionary tool designed to make building machine learning models as simple as having a conversation. With the ML Bot, even beginners can easily create, train, and deploy machine learning models. The bot not only guides you through the process but also automates all necessary steps to ensure a seamless experience.

No worries! ML Bot will interact with you to understand exactly what model you want to build, even if you're a complete beginner. That's not all. Every next step is a surprise!! The bot performs all the necessary statistical analysis, creates a machine learning pipeline, and executes it seamlessly. If this is not revolutionary, then what is? I wish you will wonder, if these features are available in the community edition, what awaits you in the prime edition!

### Steps - Install Zohencel AI
Install the latest version of Zohencel AI using pip:
